It contains tunables to execute the `pod-dns-error` experiment. This experiment disrupts DNS resolution of the targeted pods for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration. 

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Target Host Names

It defines the comma-separated name of the target hosts subjected to chaos. It can be tuned with the `TARGET_HOSTNAMES` ENV.
If `TARGET_HOSTNAMES`not provided then all hostnames/domains will be targeted.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-error/target-hostnames.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the target host names for the dns error
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-dns-error-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-dns-error
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        ## comma separated list of host names
        ## if not provided, all hostnames/domains will be targeted
        - name: TARGET_HOSTNAMES
          value: '["litmuschaos","chaosnative.com"]'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Match Scheme

It determines whether the DNS query has to match exactly with one of the targets or can have any of the targets as a substring. It can be tuned with `MATCH_SCHEME` ENV. It supports `exact` or `substring` values.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-error/match-scheme.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains match scheme for the dns error
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-dns-error-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-dns-error
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        ## it supports 'exact' and 'substring' values
        - name: MATCH_SCHEME
          value: 'exact' 
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container Runtime Socket Path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.
- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker` runtime only.
`SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/var/run/docker.sock`).

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-error/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-dns-error-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-dns-error
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # runtime for the container
        # supports docker, containerd, crio
        - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
          value: 'docker'
        # path of the socket file
        - name: SOCKET_PATH
          value: '/var/run/docker.sock'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
