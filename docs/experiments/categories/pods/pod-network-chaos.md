## Pod Network Chaos

It contains tunables to execute the pod network experiment. This experiment interrupts the network of the given pod for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration. 
It injects chaos for both `Ingress` and `Egress` traffics.

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Network Packet Loss

It defines the network packet loss percentage to be injected in the targeted application. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` ENV. 

Use the following example to tune this:

### Destination IPs And Destination Hosts

The network experiments interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. The interruption of specific IPs/Hosts can be tuned via `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` ENV.
`DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
