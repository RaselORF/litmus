Why Your Website Should be in Hindi

Hindi, historically also called Hindavi, or Hindui, is an Indo-Aryan language that is primarily spoken across various states of India and is termed the country’s national language. It is only fourth to Mandarin, Spanish, and English in terms of the number of worldwide speakers.

Hindi, although spoken across India’s length and breadth, is widely spoken across states such as Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Haryana.

The language enjoys a considerable number of speakers in many other states, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jammu, Kashmir, Uttaranchal, and others. However, yes, each of these states has got its independent, yet unofficial variant of Hindi that blends the state’s language, and dialects into the Hindi language.
